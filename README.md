Aloha, my dear friend!

Please, take a look at my solution of the assigned task *__below__*:



# HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

## Functions first

The first function *__CheckWhetherEverythingIsRight__* does what it says it does. It checks whether a user typed valid data and displays messages in the event of irrelevant data. 

## FURTHER INFORMATION

1) The user types a number of elements he wants to use in the *__array__* and then checks it in the function called *__CheckWhetherEverythingIsRight__*. If something is wrong, it displays messages.

2) Setting indexes and arrays: *__count=0__* and the indes with a lenght of *__i__*.

3) Then a user enters his data based on preferences. *__The cycle__*, built in the program, checks whether typed data is rellevant to the task, meaning it is in range between *__0 to 4__* characters. If typed data is relevant to the task, the element comes *__count++__*. 

4) Then the rpogram chnages the lenght of the array from *__i__* to *__count__*.

5) Then the program checks whether *__the lenght of the new array__* is more than *__0__*, otherwise it says that typed data is irrelevant to the program.
